# x86 Assembly (GNU as) Tools

The free/open source tools that lint, format and check x86 Assembly (GNU as)
code, and how to run them. They enforce the rules in

settings on this page.

| File | Read by |

| [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) | Editors and IDEs, through EditorConfig |

## Assembler warnings

Assembler warnings are the lint gate. Code must assemble with **no warnings**
using at least these flags:

```sh
# 64-bit ELF (Linux, BSD)
gcc -c -g -Wall -Werror -Wa,--fatal-warnings -o buf.o buf.S

# 32-bit ELF
gcc -m32 -c -g -Wall -Werror -Wa,--fatal-warnings -o buf.o buf.S

# 64-bit Windows (MinGW-w64)
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c -g -Wall -Werror -Wa,--fatal-warnings -o buf.o buf.S
```

- `-Wa,--fatal-warnings` makes the assembler treat warnings as errors, and
  `-Wall -Werror` does the same for the preprocessor, so a warning can't slip
  through a build.
- `-g` emits debug information, so debuggers and profilers can map addresses
  back to source lines.
- GNU as can't silence a warning for a few lines only. When a warning fires,
  change the code so it no longer triggers. Never turn warnings off for the
  whole build.
- When reviewing instruction encodings, generate a listing with
  `-Wa,-adhln=buf.lst`.

## Auditing

### Security analysis

No maintained FOSS static analyser reads assembly source, so audit the linked
program instead. One assembly object can turn off a protection for the whole
program it's linked into.

On ELF, run checksec on every program or shared library that links the
assembly, and check that NX, PIE and full RELRO are all enabled. An object
without the non-executable stack marker makes the whole stack executable, so
also fail the build when the stack segment is executable:

```sh
checksec file build/app
if readelf -lW build/app | grep -q 'GNU_STACK.*RWE'; then
  echo 'build/app has an executable stack' >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Bare-metal images have no PIE or RELRO, so check only that no segment is
both writable and executable, as described in the
[linker script tools](../../build/Linker-GNU-ld/tools.md#security-analysis).

On Windows, check that the linked image opts in to DEP and ASLR, and that
every routine that needs unwind data has it:

```sh
llvm-readobj --file-headers build/app.exe
llvm-readobj --unwind build/buf.o
```

The file headers' DLL characteristics must include `NX_COMPAT`,
`DYNAMIC_BASE` and `HIGH_ENTROPY_VA`. The unwind listing must have an entry
for every routine that calls others or changes `rsp`, or exceptions and
debuggers can't walk the stack through it.

### Dependency vulnerabilities

Assembly has no package manager, so there are no third-party dependencies to
audit.

### Secrets

Scan the working tree and the full git history for committed secrets. A
secret that reaches history stays exposed after it's deleted, so rotate any
secret gitleaks finds, then remove it.

```sh
gitleaks git --redact
gitleaks dir --redact
```

## Code quality

### Complexity

No maintained FOSS tool measures complexity in assembly, and lizard doesn't
read it. The closest check is the disassembly, which shows each routine's
length and every branch for review:

```sh
objdump -d --no-show-raw-insn build/buf.o
```

### Duplication

Flag any block of 50 or more tokens that appears twice. Duplicated code gets
fixed in one place and not the other.

```sh
jscpd --format nasm --formats-exts "nasm:S" --min-tokens 50 --exit-code 1 src
```

jscpd has no format for GNU as, so `--formats-exts` reads `.S` files with its
`nasm` grammar. Duplicate detection compares token sequences, so repeated
instruction sequences are still found.

### Coverage

Compiler coverage (`gcov`, `llvm-cov`) only instruments C, so it can't see
inside an assembly routine. Measure the routines' coverage from the C test
harness (see [Testing](idioms.md#testing)) under a binary-instrumentation
tool instead. It maps each executed instruction back to its source line
through the debug information the assembler records.

On Linux, kcov runs the tests and writes HTML and Cobertura reports:

```sh
kcov --include-path=src build/coverage build/tests
```

On Linux and Windows, DynamoRIO's drcov records the executed code, and
drcov2lcov turns its logs into an lcov report:

```sh
drrun -t drcov -- build/tests
drcov2lcov -dir . -output build/coverage.info -src_filter src
```

### Mutation testing

universalmutator makes small changes to the code, such as turning `jge` into
`jg`, and runs the tests against each one. A change the tests still pass, a
surviving mutant, is behaviour no test pins down. No maintained mutation
testing tool is written for x86 assembly. universalmutator works on any
language, because it rewrites the source text with regular expressions, so it's
only as good as its rules.

[`universalmutator.rules`](universalmutator.rules) holds the rules for x86.
They move and flip the condition of each jump, `setcc` and `cmovcc`, swap `add`
and `sub` and `inc` and `dec`, change immediates by one, and delete
instructions. They leave comments, directives and labels alone, since changing
those only breaks the build or changes nothing. Pass it with `--only`: the
built-in rules are written for C-like languages, and add mutants that can't
compile or can't change anything.

A full run is slow, so `scripts/audit` mutates only the source files changed
since the base branch. For each file, `mutate` writes the mutants that still
compile, and `analyze_mutants` copies each one over the file in turn, runs the
tests, and puts the file back. The last line fails when the tests kill fewer
than 80% of the mutants:

```sh
rm -rf .mutants
mkdir .mutants
files=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d origin/main... -- 'src/*.S')
for f in $files; do
  d=.mutants/$f
  mkdir -p "$d"
  mutate "$f" --only universalmutator.rules --mutantDir "$d" \
    --cmd "gcc -c -Wall -Werror -Wa,--fatal-warnings -o $d/check.o $f"
  analyze_mutants "$f" 'make test' --mutantDir "$d" --prefix "$d/run"
done
killed=$(find .mutants -name run.killed.txt -exec cat {} + | wc -l)
total=$(find .mutants -name 'run.*killed.txt' -exec cat {} + | wc -l)
echo "Mutation score: $killed of $total mutants killed"
[ "$((killed * 100))" -ge "$((total * 80))" ]
```

Install it with pip, pinned to the version this guide was checked with:

```sh
pip install universalmutator==1.14.1
```

- Replace `make test` with the project's test command that builds and runs the
  C test harness. It must rebuild from source, since each mutant replaces the
  file on disk.
- `--cmd` drops the mutants that don't assemble, so a build failure isn't
  counted as a kill. It uses the flags from
  [Assembler warnings](#assembler-warnings). Name the file in `--cmd`, not the
  `MUTANT` placeholder, which crashes version 1.14.1.
- A test run that takes longer than 30 seconds is stopped and counted as a
  kill. If the build and tests take longer, give `analyze_mutants` a larger
  `--timeout`.
- Run it on a clean working tree, and add `.mutants/` to `.gitignore`. If a run
  is interrupted, `git status` shows a file it left mutated.

80% is the same bar as coverage. Some mutants can't change what the code does,
so 100% is rarely reachable; 80% leaves room for them and still fails a change
whose tests check little.

`.mutants/<file>/run.notkilled.txt` lists the survivors of each file. Compare
one with the source to see what changed:

```text
$ diff src/grade.S .mutants/src/grade.S/grade.mutant.11.S
11c11
< 	jge	.Lgrade_p
---
> 	jg	.Lgrade_p
```

Read it as a missing test: here, the jump to the pass grade follows
`cmpl $50, %edi`, and no test passes exactly 50, so the boundary isn't pinned
down. Write the test that fails on the mutant, not one that just runs the line.
A mutant that can't change behaviour needs no test; the threshold allows for
it.
